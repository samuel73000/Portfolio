      "The main challenge was to make the project compatible with various screen sizes while adhering to the design specifications. I used flexbox to create a responsive layout, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices. I worked closely with the designers to seamlessly integrate visual elements into the layout, thus ensuring both an aesthetic and functional presentation on large desktop screens, tablets, and smartphones",
      "The project was designed with a 'mobile-first' approach, meaning I prioritized optimizing the user experience on mobile devices. This strategy ensures that users have a smooth and responsive experience regardless of the device they are using, from smartphones to desktop computers. Additionally, to make the site even more appealing, I integrated smooth and natural animations. These animations were carefully crafted to enhance the site's interactivity, providing visitors with an engaging and immersive experience",
      "The objective was to modernize the existing platform using JavaScript to optimize the user experience across various screen sizes. I enhanced the site's interactivity by integrating a slider with active bullet points and text corresponding to the displayed image",
      "The objective was to modernize the existing platform using React to optimize the user experience across various screen sizes. I enhanced the site's interactivity by integrating CSS animations while introducing advanced elements, such as creating a carousel to display property images, implementing a collapse feature to improve UX, and dynamically managing property listings based on internal data. Additionally, I used Sass to enhance style management.",
      "En tant que membre de l'équipe Argent Bank, j'ai joué un rôle central dans la mise en place de l'authentification utilisateur avec JWT (JSON Web Tokens) et Axios pour des appels API sécurisés. J'ai également dirigé la gestion des données via Redux, en permettant notamment aux utilisateurs de récupérer leurs informations en se connectant mais également pouvoir en modifier certaines s'ils le souhaitent. L'utilisation de Swagger a facilité la conception et la documentation des API, accélérant le développement de nouvelles fonctionnalités et renforçant la sécurité, les performances et l'expérience utilisateur dans l'application Argent Bank. Mon rôle comprenait aussi la définition des routes pour les transactions dans l'éditeur de Swagger, ce qui impliquait de choisir les méthodes HTTP appropriées, telles que GET, PUT ou DELETE, pour simplifier leur gestion future. J'ai également contribué au Green Code en optimisant les images pour améliorer les performances de l'application et en créant des composants réutilisables pour favoriser les bonnes pratiques de développement.",
      "The objective was to fix the various bugs that the website had by creating unit tests and using existing tests to identify and correct the bugs. I familiarized myself with Jest",
